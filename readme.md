# prollipop üç≠

A modded [Prolly-tree](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-03-prolly-trees/) implementation in Typescript.

## Features

- **Efficient diff** - yields entry and bucket diffs!
- **Powerful cursor api** - climb üå≥s like a pro
- **Structural validation** - codec is aware of tree context

## Project Status

Investigating a bug that has to do with async iterable updates given to mutate function.

It's in a decent state but have not done performance analysis. API breaks will result in major version change.

I haven't tested with non-local blockstores. Things may not work well with networked blockstores.

## Data-structure

This package implements a modded prolly-tree in Typescript. Most relevant code is in [`src/mutate.ts`](https://github.com/tabcat/prollipop/blob/master/src/mutate.ts) and [`src/diff.ts`](https://github.com/tabcat/prollipop/blob/master/src/diff.ts).

mods:

- (number, uint8array) tuples for keys
- right-side backbone
- key-defined boundaries instead of rolling-hash

## Install

`npm install prollipop`

## Build

`pnpm install && pnpm build`

## Usage

**See [usage.test.ts](https://github.com/tabcat/prollipop/blob/master/test/usage.test.ts)!!!**

**API [docs](https://tabcat.github.io/prollipop/)**
